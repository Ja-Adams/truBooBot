# truBooBot

This is a proof of work showcasing a Discord chat bot with various functions.

Files were taken out of this version, notably the bot's token which it needs to run and be used on Discord. 

If you would like to try the bot, I would recommend going to Discord's developer website and generating your own token, 
then creating your own config.json and putting | "token": <your token> | to try it out
